```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1) Import the climate data. 
```{r ClimateData}
ClimateData = read.table("D:/Yifu Qian's love/UCSB Learning/2016 -2017 Spring Quarter/Environmental Informatics/test2/clim.txt", header=TRUE)
summary(ClimateData)
```

2) Graph precipitation and average temperature by month, using a box plot.

Add a average temperature column to the data.
```{r AddMeanTemperature, echo = TRUE, eval=TRUE}
MeanTemp = (ClimateData$tmin + ClimateData$tmax)/2
ClimateData$tmean = MeanTemp
```

Using boxplot.
```{r BoxPlot for precipitation and average temperature by month, echo = TRUE, eval=TRUE}

boxplot(data = ClimateData, tmean ~ month, main = "Climate Data: Mean Temperature Grouped by Months", xlab = "Month", ylab = "Mean Temperature")
boxplot(data = ClimateData, rain ~ month, main = "Climate Data: Precipitation Grouped by Months", xlab = "Month", ylab = "Precipitation")
```

3) Find the wettest and dryest year.
```{r sum precipitation within years, echo = TRUE, eval=TRUE}
rain.yr = aggregate(ClimateData$rain, by=list(ClimateData$year), sum)
colnames(rain.yr) = c("Year", "AnnualPrecipitation")
```
```{r find the wettest and dryest year}
WetYear = which.max(rain.yr$AnnualPrecipitation)
rain.yr[WetYear,]

DryYear = which.min(rain.yr$AnnualPrecipitation)
rain.yr[DryYear,]
```
Therefore, the wettest and the dryest year are 1982 and 2013 respectively.

4) Add two photos to show wet year and dry year.

![Dry Year](D:/Yifu Qian's love/UCSB Learning/2016 -2017 Spring Quarter/Environmental Informatics/test2/DryYear.jpg)

5) Create a new "season" variable
```{r season variable creation}
ClimateData$Season = ifelse(ClimateData$month %in% c(11,12,1),4, 
                            ifelse(ClimateData$month %in% c(2,3,4),1,
                                   ifelse(ClimateData$month %in% c(5,6,7),2,3)))
```

6) Find wettest and driest seasons
```{r find the wettest and dryest season}
rain.onlyseason = aggregate(ClimateData$rain, by=list(ClimateData$Season), sum)

WetSeason = which.max(rain.onlyseason$x)
rain.onlyseason[WetSeason,]

DrySeason = which.min(rain.onlyseason$x)
rain.onlyseason[DrySeason,]
```

Therefore, the wettest season is winter and the dryest season is summer. 

7) Plot the relationship between winter precipitation and summer temperature
```{r Plot the relationship between winter precipitation and summer temperature}
rain.season = aggregate(ClimateData$rain, by=list(ClimateData$Season, ClimateData$year), sum) 
temp.season = aggregate(ClimateData$tmean,by=list(ClimateData$Season, ClimateData$year), mean)

plot(rain.season$x[rain.season$Group.1 == "4"] ~ temp.season$x[temp.season$Group.1 == "2"], main = "Winter Precipitation v.s. Summer Temperature", xlab = "Summer Temperature", ylab = "Winter Precipitation")
```

The plot shows that there not strong correlation between winter precipitation and summer temperature. Their relationship looks random.

Positive (negative) precipiation anomalies during winter could be associated with wetter (drier) soils, a later (earlier) date of snowmelt, cooler (warmer) air temperatures, and more (less) evaporation during spring and summer.
